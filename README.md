# LETS LIVE

## NOTE
This project aims to satisfy myself and helps me to learn things. Although this is a open-source project, I don't seek help.
As I wrote the note, I find it a bit cringe and unnecessary but that's what it is and I just want to be sure.

## MOTIVATION
When I was 3rd year in my university, I have chosen a class with a project related to livestreaming technologies. I felt like it was a perfect project with moderate difficulty. But sadly, it fell off with a miserable grade cause I had used out-of-the-box solutions like Nginx, HAProxy, etc...

So this time I gonna build my project from the ground while looking for something alike likes "owncast".

## ABOUT
