# LETS LIVE

## MOTIVATION
When I was 3rd year in my university, I have chosen a class with a project related to livestreaming technologies. I felt like it was a perfect project with moderate difficulty. But sadly, it fell off with a miserable grade.

So this time I gonna build my project from the ground while looking for something alike likes "owncast", "mediamtx" and "twitch".

## ABOUT
